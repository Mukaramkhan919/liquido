## Installation

To get started with Liquido, you need to add it to your Flutter project. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  liquido: ^1.0.0
```

After saving the file, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Usage

Using Liquido is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to help you get started.

### Step 1: Import the Package

In your Dart file, import the Liquido package:

```dart
import 'package:liquido/liquido.dart';
```

### Step 2: Create a Liquid Glass Widget

You can create a Liquid Glass effect using the `LiquidGlass` widget. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```dart
LiquidGlass(
  child: Container(
    height: 200,
    width: 200,
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, Liquido!',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
      ),
    ),
  ),
),
```

### Step 3: Customize Your Effect

You can customize the appearance of the Liquid Glass effect by adjusting properties such as `blur`, `opacity`, and `borderRadius`. Hereâ€™s an example:

```dart
LiquidGlass(
  blur: 10.0,
  opacity: 0.8,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
  child: Container(
    height: 200,
    width: 200,
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(
      child: Text(
        'Stylish Glass!',
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
      ),
    ),
  ),
),
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Liquid Glass Effect

This example shows a simple Liquid Glass effect on a button.

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  child: LiquidGlass(
    child: Text('Click Me'),
  ),
),
```

### Example 2: Customizable Liquid Glass Card

This example demonstrates how to create a card with a Liquid Glass effect.

```dart
Card(
  child: LiquidGlass(
    blur: 15.0,
    opacity: 0.9,
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20),
    child: Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: Text('This is a card with Liquid Glass effect.'),
    ),
